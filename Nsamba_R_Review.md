#     Markdown files
The author did a great job desribing the steps he used to work through the assignment from downloading the files from internet through processing them to address the questions. His entire workflow is very easy to follow and the Markdown file well written.
---

##    Data inspection
The author used the functions learnt in class to inspect his data and very well described it. However, he did not include the return files of the data inspection functions. I guess its not necessary although it would look very neat.

###   File formatting, data processing and outputs
To process the files, the author used the codes learnt in class in a proper way and his codes were very robust. His entire workflow outlined in the R_Markdown file is very easy to follow and thus very reproducible.
---

####  File Organization and storage
I could easily understand the output for both Maize and Teosinte IDs on all chromosomes with SNPs based on increasing and decreasing SNP position values. Files were very well formatted, and stored in various folders thus making the work more organized.

##### Part II: Graphs
The author first re-shaped the data using the melt function to make his files tidy. He went futher to plot the first graph. He was expected to interpret the graph to indicate the chromosome with most SNPs which he didn't.

The author didn't succeed to plot graph 2 although reported to have tried on it.

He finally did a visualization of his own as required by the assignment.

#In General,
1. Files were accurately uploaded from the internet
2. Properly inspected and described
3. Codes were acculately assigned to process the data making it reproducible
4. Final formatted files were very well organized.
